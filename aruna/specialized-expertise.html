												I may be one of the only psychiatrists in the country that has a Masters Level body of knowledge in theory on marginalized identities. <i>This is important because it could really affect you.</i>
											</p>
											<p>
												My background is literary, and I have a love of stories, people, and immersing myself in other worlds.  I majored in English at the University of Michigan, and completed a Masters of Humanities at the University of Chicago focusing gender theory, race theory, African American Studies, Embodiment, Post Colonialism, Sexuality, queer theory, Culture, South Asian Studies, and Marxism.
											</p>
											<p>
												This is important because if conscious and unconscious structures of racism/ sexism/ homophobia, classism exist in all aspects of our world, why wouldn’t it exist in your psychiatrist? Why would your  psychiatrist be spared ? And, how would that affect you? Worse yet, could the very act of seeking help actually be destructive towards you?
											</p>
											<p>
												Blackness. Whiteness. Mixed Ethnicity.  Masculinity. Femininity. Sex. Identity. Queer. These questions often go unexplored as marginalized groups often face the dual problem of wanting to explore their identity, while living in a world that situates them, as the very cause of the worlds problem-situating them as Other, and locating them as the cause of their frustrations. How do you live in a world like that?
											</p>
											<p>
												I have a high level of expertise in seeing both the conscious and unconscious structures of racism/sexism/ homophobia/classism that would allow a real safety in treating marginalized groups who may want to change aspects of themselves, and struggle with or be curious about questions around their identity.  They haven’t felt safe to explore these questions for REAL reasons including the onslaught of unrecognized racism/ sexism/classism in a world that they face on a daily basis, and the long dirty history of psychiatry and psychology in pathologizing marginalized group by not accounting for aspects of differences in experience, and dismissing differences in how different people are treated as ‘fantasy’ or worse yet, blaming them.   To every person, who has been harmed by psychiatry or psychology, I would like to extend an apology.  Enough is enough. It’s time.

												I arise from a performing arts and literary background which infuses all of my understanding.
											</p>
											<p>
												I have a particular focus in the performing arts: dancers, musicians, comedians, actors and actresses, where there is a live interaction with the audience. I also treat visual and applied artists who exist very differently in the world. They create their work in solitude, and then put it out to the world. The absence of the arts in the everyday can pose real problems and sadness for people, and I see an explosion of creativity as a goal for our roadtrip.

												How we treat people in prison is a marker of our psychological health as a society.
											</p>
											<p>
												It brings up questions about how we treat our most disenfranchised, how we think about their rights, how we conceive of people who have had limited resources, mental illness, and how dynamics such as race and poverty often determine who gets incarcerated and who doesn’t, and why that happens. I also have a lot of background in the public sector, including working with incarcerated individuals, in prison settings, poor populations in the community with schizophrenia and high risk individuals that have had multiple psychiatric hospitalizations and histories of violence. I treat and get called in for consultations, and can offer expert opinion.

												Psychoanalysis has a long history of harm amongst marginalized identities.
											</p>
											<p>
												It is exists within in a worldview of structuralized racism and sexism, but curiously operates, as if, it does not. These dynamics can come alive in a psychoanalysis and cause irreparable harm to a patient. A psychoanalyst may be aware that something is not working in the treatment, but may not even be aware of even considering unconscious forces of racism/ sexism at play. They may be limited in the scope of their thinking by only seeing a dynamic in terms of transference/countertransference. Or they may feel too shameful or judged in acknowledging and seeking help in this area. I seek to bridge the gap between the pair by using forensic methods and critical theory to examine the REALITY of the analysis, so that the analysand can get the help they need, and move forward with their life, either by seeking a different treatment OR to seek a bridge between the pair, so the analyst can be brave enough to look at unconscious aspects of themselves and how they may be causing harm. Over time, I hope to undo the long and painful legacy of psychoanalysis has in causing harm amongst marginalized identities, by opening a spark of change so that this treatment modality can begin to be useful for marginalized identities. Reparation is real. I hope to cause a healing on both sides, and strive for a world, where this no longer exists. One consultation at a time.
