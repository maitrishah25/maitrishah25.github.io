								I am a psychiatrist who is interested in people who feel they are outsiders for various reasons. I am also a psychoanalyst and do this supposedly archaic practice of psychoanalysis. I have a private practice in Morningside Heights aka Harlem --the hood of renaissance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The meetpoint is a humble sanctuary for ALL kinds of people. Whoever you are, and wherever you come from, our world is better because of you. Conservative, Liberal, Old, Young, Blue, Black, CIS, Trans, Asian, Fat, Skinny, rural, urban, B-baller, international, ex-pat, Rapper, Queer, White, Muslim, Biker, Rocker , Lax player, Atheist, Trump Supporter, Darwinist, Trump Hater.
							</p>
							<p>
								Does it matter? Has anyone ever told you, that you can’t because of <i>who</i> you are? You feel on the outside, at the edges, not in and not out…
							</p>
							<p>
								All are welcome at the meetpoint. I am interested <i>in every single</i> person who has a story that has yet to be told.
							</p>
							<p>
								Consider this is your home.
							</p>
							<p class="lead">
								I want to hear your story in your voice.<br>Let’s create it.

											<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??</p>
											<span>It may mean that I roadtrip with someone--</span>
											<ul>
												<li>around a loss of a loved one, and they have gotten depressed.</li>
												<li>who feels they need alcohol to take the edge off, and feel more free with people.</li>
												<li>who works successfully in Finance, who has Bipolar illness and has stayed out of a hospital, but comes off medications cyclically around the anniversary of their divorce.</li>
												<li>who feels so hopeless and so bad about themselves, they struggle to get out of bed. They aren’t eating well or sleeping well. Or, they maybe it’s the opposite. They are overeating, and oversleeping. But they are left feeling fatigued, unmotivated, and like things will never get better.</li>
												<li>in graduate school, who comes in with PTSD, and that we work together to stabilize their sleep and reduce nightmares.</li>
												<li>who is amidst a gender transition.</li>
												<li>who feels suicidal.</li>
												<li>through her pregnancy and postpartum period, where she perhaps began to lose touch with reality or become devastatingly sad for no apparent reason.</li>
												<li>who has difficulty with attention.</li>
												<li>who talks really fast, feels like their mind is moving at top speed, and feels like they don’t need to sleep because there is so much for them to do.</li>
												<li>who is Hasidic who is attempting to figure out what parts of their culture they want to keep and what part is not them, to make Hasidism their own thing. Or, may be considering leaving Hasidic community, but still wanting to be part of larger Jewish Identity.</li>
												<li>who has difficulty with their body image and self-worth. They may over exercise or cut calories. Or, they may use laxative or throw up. Or they make think that something is ‘wrong’ with some part of their body. Or they may not do any of these things, but still have these thoughts that something is wrong with them.</li>
												<li>who occasionally hears voices and gets paranoid.</li>
												<li>who has thoughts about suicide.</li>
												<li>who has mixed feelings about their partner or their child,  but feels guilty or ashamed acknowledging negative feelings.</li>
												<li>who ‘needs’ to smoke pot daily. It’s almost part of their identity.</li>

										<div class="tab-content">
											<p class="lead">Yes. This is for real. And, yes, it is also related to the kind of psychotherapy I do with people.  But Freud is dead you say, and well.. … he is. But, I ain’t….and I ride a little different.</p>
											<p>I am adept at treating high functioning individuals who have jobs and significant relationships, but may have struggles in certain areas that impact their personal or professional lives.</p>
											<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??</p>
											<span>It may mean that I ride with someone who--</span>
											<ul>
												<li>struggles with creative blocks, procrastination, and difficulty engaging in their pursuits.</li>
												<li>has profound questions about identity and who they are. This may be in the form of gender, sexuality, or even wondering about their experience of ‘blackness’ or ‘whiteness’ and what that may mean.</li>
												<li>feels like they have been living their life in a certain way, but it’s not their way and they are not happy with it. They feel like enough is enough, and it’s time.</li>
												<li>feels like they live their perfect existence out on Instagram, but isn’t happy with the rest of their real life.</li>
												<li>who has strong negative feelings towards her baby or husband that she is too ashamed to talk about, or even acknowledge out loud to herself.</li>
												<li>continually undermines their own success.</li>
												<li>is curious about understanding why he keeps falling in love with unavailable women, when this only leaves him sad and alone.</li>
												<li>has difficulty in close relationships, and often ‘gets bored’, the more time passes.</li>
												<li>is not clinically depressed but struggles to find meaning or pleasure in their lives.</li>
