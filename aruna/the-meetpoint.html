											<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??</p>
											<ul>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone around a loss of a loved one, and they have gotten depressed.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who feels they need alcohol to take the edge off, and feel more free with people.</li>
												<li>This may mean that I work someone who works successfully in Finance, who has Bipolar illness and has stayed out of a hospital, but comes off medications cyclically around the anniversary of their divorce.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who feels so hopeless and so bad about themselves, they struggle to get out of bed. They aren’t eating well or sleeping well. Or, they maybe it’s the opposite. They are overeating, and oversleeping. But they are left feeling fatigued, unmotivated, and like things will never get better.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I treat a graduate student who comes in with PTSD, and that we work together to stabilize their sleep and reduce nightmares.</li>
												<li>It may mean I work with someone amidst a gender transition.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who feels suicidal.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I am working with a woman through her pregnancy and postpartum period, where she perhaps began to lose touch with reality or become devastatingly sad for no apparent reason.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who has difficulty with attention.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who talks really fast, feels like their mind is moving at top speed, and feels like they don’t need to sleep because there is so much for them to do.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who is Hasidic who is attempting to figure out what parts of their culture they want to keep and what part is not them, to make Hasidism their own thing.  Or, may be considering leaving Hasidic community, but still wanting to be part of larger Jewish Identity.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who has difficulty with their body image and self-worth. They may over exercise or cut calories. Or, they may use laxative or throw up. Or they make think that something is ‘wrong’ with some part of their body. Or they may not do any of these things, but still have these thoughts that something is wrong with them.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who occasionally hears voices and gets paranoid.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who has thoughts about suicide.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with a spouse, who has mixed feelings about their partner or their child,  but feels guilty or ashamed acknowledging negative feelings.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who ‘needs’ to smoke pot daily. It’s almost part of their identity.</li>

											<p class="lead">Yes. This is for real. And, yes, it is also related to the kind of psychotherapy I do with people.  But Freud is dead you say, and well.. … he is. But, I ain’t….and I ride a little different.</p>
											<p>I am adept at treating high functioning individuals who have jobs and significant relationships, but may have struggles in certain areas that impact their personal or professional lives.</p>
											<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??</p>
											<ul>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who struggles with creative blocks, procrastination, and difficulty engaging in their pursuits.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I am working with someone who has profound questions about identity and who they are. This may be in the form of gender, sexuality, or even wondering about their experience of ‘blackness’ or ‘whiteness’ and what that may mean.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who feels like they have been living their life in a certain way, but it’s not their way and they are not happy with it. They feel like enough is enough, and it’s time.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who feels like they live their perfect existence out on Instagram, but isn’t happy with the rest of their real life.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with woman who has strong negative feelings towards her baby or husband that she is too ashamed to talk about, or even acknowledge out loud to herself.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who continually undermines their own success.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with a man who is curious about understanding why he keeps falling in love with unavailable women, when this only leaves him sad and alone.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I work with someone who has difficulty in close relationships, and often ‘gets bored’, the more time passes.</li>
												<li>It may mean that I treat someone who is not clinically depressed but struggles to find meaning or pleasure in their lives.</li>
