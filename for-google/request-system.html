<h4>The Project</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">The ask was to create CX strategy that could contribute a competitive edge in a bid for a multimillion-dollar contract with the MBTA. 
<br>
This was the first time our department was trying this out, as a potential new capability offered by our department. 
<br>
With no directions, precedent or formal experience in CX strategy, I stared at the wall for awhile and then googled things to figure out what to do. I decided to start with understanding the touchpoints involved – the audiences, businesses and geography – and see where meaningful connections could be made.
</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I held discovery workshops, created surveys, read audience demographic reports, sourced audience segment representatives for 1:1 interviews, and researched points of interest. 
</p>
<h4>Synthesis</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">The research gave me footing to start building the strategy. For example, one interviewee expressed that a particular line was so slow that he could get to his destination faster by walking. This was reiterated in other research. Since the MBTA wanted the billboard content to nudge the public to start riding again, this was useful perspective in considering messaging that could be empathetic and resonate with the public. 
</p>
<h4>Personas, Journey Maps and Content Strategy</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I created detailed personas including research insights that could be tied back to the MBTA's objectives, and built journey maps to illustrate each persona's interactions with the billboard screens as they went about their days. Content concepts for the screens in these moments were then crafted through the lens of each persona. I then fleshed out the concepts with consideration to the dynamic capabilities of the screens, such as real-time data feeds or using a QR code for a connected experience. I worked with the team to produce sample creative to help visualize the ideas.
</p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">
After winning the contract, we worked closely with the MBTA to execute on the CX strategy. I was asked to continue my work in this area, producing CX strategy that helped win another multimillion-dollar contract with the CTA, and as part of a marketing research study published by OUTFRONT Media.
