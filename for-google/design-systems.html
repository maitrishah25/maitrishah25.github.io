<h4>The Situation</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">Gallagher is a global financial services brokerage with over 35,000 employees and a portfolio of brands. Historically, there had been no in-house design leadership to help bring together designers on various teams, external creative agencies and developer teams around the world to make considered, cohesive digital experiences and products a reality. 
</p>
<h4>The Opportunity</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I had the good luck to be hired by someone who has an enthusiasm for modern, accessible, inclusive designs. She gave me the space to identify opportunities and also to create my own team. As soon as I began working, it was immediately obvious to me that there wasn't a familiarity with design systems at the company. And that it was a solution that would help improve the consistency and cohesiveness of designs that could work at scale and over time as brands evolved – if we set up correctly and maintain it effectively, and if consumer teams accept and adopt it.
</p>
<h4>Introduction to the Immediate Team</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I started talking about concepts like design systems, interaction states and type scale in daily conversations with my cross-functional team of scrum masters, dev leads, web operations management and product owners and collaborated with them to create user stories dedicated to systems work in parallel to designing experiences.  
</p>
<h4>The Beginning of Systems Design</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">The first system we worked on was for the brand that we were designing an experience for at the time. It was a relatively barebones system but covered the type scale, palette with tints and shades, buttons, links and form controls. Seeing these elements laid out in a library of symbols made the purpose of the system immediately clear to others. With increased buyin of the concept, I was able to allocate more time to systems and build off the work we'd already done by continuing to refine and improve it. 
</p>
<h4>Team Collaboration and Transition from Sketch to Figma</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">By this point I had also recruited 4 designers to my team and we were learning how to work on systems as a team. I focused each designer on tasks directly related to their individual strengths, such as meticulousness, creativity and familiarity with applying accessibility standards. We worked together toward our shared standards and dream for great design.
<br>
I tested such things as cadence for making updates to the system, like whether to make updates continuously or collect all updates into a queue to discuss in our end of sprint wrapup team call before publishing. We would weigh how tests went with consideration to hopefully scaling in the near future. 
<br>
We were also transitioning from Sketch to Figma. While that meant rebuilding our systems to some extent, we were excited to move to a tool that would enhance team collaboration.

<h4>Maturing of Systems for Use by Consumer Teams</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">On Figma, we began our systems setup with our flagship brand and wanted to develop it at a level where it could be user by our consumer teams around the world. With consideration to naming conventions, architecture of component tiers with dynamic flexibility across multiple dimensions, and thoughtful documentation – and lots of testing, learning and iterating – we're ready to roll out the initial version of the AJG design system.
</p>
<h4>Sharing With Dev, QA and Web Operations Teams</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">In a nutshell, we collaborated with our partner teams for alignment on our approach between design and development. The introduction of systems on the design side initiated a reconsideration of the setup on the development side. Beyond the fonts and colors in the style sheets, dev was previously baking custom styles directly into each component they were building, without leveraging a dev library that mirrored the design system. This approach made their level of effort unnecessarily high on such updates as implementing tweaks to elements that were present across multiple components. It also unnecessarily left a lot of room for inconsistency. While building this dev library was obviously a sizable undertaking, the advantages were clear. 
</p>
<h4>Sharing With Consumer Creative Teams in UK, Australia, Caribbean and LatAm</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">We gave demos at department all-hands meetings and additional demos per request. We wanted anyone who was interested in the system to be able to leverage it in their work. We found that the interest extended beyond UX/UI designers to other creatives who also saw benefit in the ability to quickly and easily mock up screens.
</p>
<h4>Establishing a Feedback Loop</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">As the maintaining team, we explicitly encourage feedback and suggestions for the system so that we can work on evolving it effectively per business objectives and the needs of our consumer teams. 
</p>
<h4>Governance Planning</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">Now with the release of our AJG design system, some focus has shifted to maintenance and governance of the system. This planning includes the feedback loop, a review process for making and publishing system updates, regular review of system analytics in Figma to identify potential areas for improvement, and recordkeeping in a version log.  
</p>
<h4>Creating a Version Log</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">We are excited about how responsive our system will be to future updates, and we are currently developing the criteria that constitutes the versioning increments.
</p>
<h4>Planning for an Ecosystem of Systems</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">Concurrently, we are working on standing up a system for another brand in the Gallagher portfolio. We are considering how to best leverage the "master" AJG system by maintaining commonalities whilst allowing for custom brand-specific touches. We are interested in the concept of design tokens where values for one brand can be swapped out for values of another brand and would like to explore that further. 
</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I feel grateful to lead a design team that is tight-knit and shares in the vision for performance design at Gallagher. I'm thankful for the opportunity and space to have my suggestions welcomed. I'm very proud of the team and our commitment to learning and improving together.
