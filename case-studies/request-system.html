<h4>The Situation</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">Over months, I observed daily interactions between my neighboring teams of marketing managers and graphic designers. Ad hoc conversations were how marketing managers would initiate art requests to designers, with follow-up conversations as needed to complete the exchange of details needed. I observed a feeling of frustration from members across both teams. 
</p>
<h4>The Opportunity</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I noticed there was a lack of documentation, prioritization and visibility of open requests contributing to both teams' frustration. While it was not my job, a solution to help ease this pain point for the teams was just so obvious to me: a standardized request template and centralized repository for the requests. 
</p>
<h4>Standardized Request Template</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I created a simple document template with form fields that reflected the information needed for every request.  
</p>
<h4>Centralized Repository System</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">I created a folder on our department's shared drive where completed requests could be placed. With the rule that each request's filename starts with the campaign's go-live date, the requests would autosort based on urgency. This way, the design team could go into the folder, see all open requests at a glance and collaboratively work through them in order, with all necessary information provided! When requests were completed, they could be moved to the completed folder and the corresponding artwork dropped into the art library folder.
</p>
<h4>Department Approval, Adoption and Change Management</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">
I presented the idea to my department head, who immediately approved it. He asked me to set up a meeting with the department so that I could introduce it to them.
<br>
At first, there was some hesitation from the marketing managers in adopting the new way of making requests. It was a change from how they were used to doing things. At first, some were also incorrectly formatting filenames which was impacting the autosort. But with some continued support from my end and encouragement of the department head, the team eventually developed the habit and ultimately came to rely on the system. The graphic designers appreciated having a point of reference when questions arose on delivered artwork. Department leadership appreciated the ability to see the status of any and all requests at any given time. But beyond what was said to me, they continued using the system for at least the remainder of years I was at the company, which is the clearest way of knowing that the users felt it was an improvement to their workflow. 
</p>
<h4>Transparency, High-Level Analysis and Design Evolution</h4>
<p style="color: hsla(0,0%,100%,.4)">Ultimately, the art request system and process created visibility into the requests for the entire department, allowing faster turnaround and fewer miscommunications. Additionally, there was now a way for leadership to perform high-level analysis. And from time to time, it was fun to be able to open the art library and see the evolution of designs over the years.
